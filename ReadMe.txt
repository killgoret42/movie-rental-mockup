This is a project that I adapted from a college project so that I could use it as an example of my coding ability. Originally the project used a SQLServer database, but I adapted it so it could use an Access database on my home machine.

This project was made to imitate a movie rental system. Create an account and sign in, and you will be able to browse through the
movie database, and select movies for rental. If you sign in with an admin account, you will be able to perform CRUD operations on
the database through the application. You can interact with all four tables of the database: Movies, Members, Genres, and Rentals.

In the forms that allow you to interact with the database, you can add, update, and delete entries of the database after filling
in the required information. If you click the browse button, the list will show you the information in the table
you are interacting with. After making a change to the table, click the browse button again to update the view and see your changes.

If you want to test out the admin features, you can use the following login information:
Username: admin
Password: password

NOTE: you will need AccessDatabaseEngine installed for the program to function properly. You can download it from Microsoft with this link https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255
You will need the 32 bit version, listed as AccessDatabaseEngine.exe, NOT  the 64 bit one listed as AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe
